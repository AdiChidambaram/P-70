C fore researchers visited each school shortlisted for ranking based on the objective and perceptual data collected. The data gathered was also audited by talking to parents and students.

Online school is the only way kids can learn but it spoils their eyes and they would have to wear glasses. With online education, students can turn anywhere with Internet access and electricity into a classroom. It can include audio, video, text, animations, virtual training environments and live chats with professors. It's a rich learning environment with much more ﬂexibility than a traditional classroom.
